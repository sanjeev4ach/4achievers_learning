Desired Capabilities is a class in Selenium used to set properties of browsers to perform cross browser testing 
of web applications. It stores the capabilities as key-value pairs and these capabilities are used to set browser
properties like browser name, browser version, path of browser driver in the system, etc. to determine the behaviour of browser at run time.

Desired capability can also be used to configure the driver instance of Selenium WebDriver.
We can configure driver instance like FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver, InternetExplorerDriver by using desired capabilities.


Use when we need to run cases on a remote machine then we use desiredCapabilities

Itâ€™s a huge challenge for QA engineers to roll out robust web-applications that provide a seamless user experience across a variety of devices. 
Considering a large number of devices and browsers in the market, QAs need to test web-applications in different environments to ensure they meet market 
requirements.

These environments include different mobile devices, web-browsers, emulators, or simulators. 
To use the desired environment, QAs use DesiredCapabilities in test automation frameworks like Selenium. 
it helps QAs test web-apps for cross browser compatibility testing across multiple devices and platforms.

DesiredCapabilities are a set of key-value pairs encoded as a JSON object. 
It helps QAs define basic test requirements such as operating systems, browser combinations, browser versions, etc. within Selenium test scripts. 
The DesiredCapabilities Class has multiple methods that let QAs specify the required properties regarding the desired test environments.

One can quickly refer to the GitHub library for Desired Capabilities to understand all the available methods.



Why do we need Desired Capabilities?

1. Desired Capabilities are needed because every Testing scenario should be executed on some specific testing environment. 
2. The testing environment can be a web browser, Mobile device, mobile emulator, mobile simulator, etc. 
3. The Desired Capabilities Class helps us to tell the webdriver, which environment we are going to use in our test script.

4. Each specific test case needs to be executed in a different environment (browser, mobile, or an operating system) as per the market trends. 
For example, a QA might need to test a Web-application on two different browsers (Chrome, Safari) installed on mobile devices running on different operating systems (Android, iOS).
This is where Desired Capabilities enables QAs to instruct the Selenium WebDriver regarding the environment to be used while performing the tests. 
Using the setCapabilities method from the DesiredCapabilities class, QAs can execute parallel tests on desired devices, browsers, and operating systems available on a Cloud Selenium Grid.



Desired Capabilities are more useful in cases like:

In mobile application automation, where the browser properties and the device properties can be set.
In Selenium grid when we want to run the test cases on a different browser with different operating systems and versions.
